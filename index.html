            <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve
                <br> my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing
                <br> some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell
                <br> phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more
                <br> sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble)
                <br> made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that
                <br> the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.

            <p>By looking at problems from a different

                <br> valuable.

                <br> resolve to end it.

            <h2>Share and show your work</h2>
            <p>As designers, we are often afraid of showing work
                <br> that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will
                <br> learn to accept feedback and learn from it.

            <p>It has to be a problem that’s personally affecting or affected you, like
                <br> finding your keys, calling a taxi or even remembering something. Open your
                <br> eyes, look around you carefully and pay close attention to your

            <p>It's time to look for solutions. What can you do to solve these problems? It's

            <p>How can design help solve your problem? It's time to think about features
                <br> and functionality, and then start designing. Don’t forget to always ask
                <br> yourself: Would I actually use this?
